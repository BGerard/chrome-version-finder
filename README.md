Chromium Version Finder  
=======================
Google does not provide direct links to legacy Chromium versions. Finding them is not easy, this script does it for you.
Currently only Linux packages are supported.

## Usage

    npx chromium-version-finder <chromium major version>
   
  **Example:**

    #: npx chromium-version-finder 85
